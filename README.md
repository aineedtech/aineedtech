  ⚒ Geoscientist turned Code Lover 💻

<hr style="border:1.5px solid gray"> </hr>

Passionate about unraveling the Earth's mysteries and looking for ways to bring in technology into my day-to-day job, from creating cool web apps to applying machine learning and AI. 

When I'm not coding, you'll find me learning German, hitting the pavement for a run, or getting lost in a good book (currently at 87 consecutive days!). 

Let's connect and create together on this exciting journey. Find me at <a href="https://twitter.com/aineedtech">aineedtech</a> on Twitter.

I'm a geoscientist from Malaysia. I look at rocks and the earth subsurface during my day-to-day job. I find creating things and problem solving satisfying, hence I decided to learn to code and build cool things with it!
- 👩‍💻 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and Python.
- 🤓 I also geek out on geophysics, language learning, and event planning.
- 📫 You can reach me at <a href="https://twitter.com/aineedtech">aineedtech</a> on Twitter
- ⚡ Fun fact: My first programming language is Bash!
**aineedtech/aineedtech** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
