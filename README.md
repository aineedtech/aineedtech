I'm a geoscientist from Malaysia. I look at rocks and the earth subsurface on a daily basis. But I also find creating things and problem solving satisfying, so I decided to learn to code to build cool things with it!

My goal is to brush up on HTML and CSS before I move on to JavaScript and other programming languages. Other than Web Development, I am also interested in Data Science and have been enjoying Kaggle short courses. Right now I am working on HTML/CSS challenges from Frontend Mentor and brushing up on my Python.

- 👩‍💻 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and Python.
- 🤓 I also geek out on geophysics, language learning, and event planning.

- ⚡ Fun fact: My first programming language is Bash!
