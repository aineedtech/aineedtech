I'm a geoscientist from Malaysia. Although I look at rocks and the earth subsurface on a daily basis, I find creating things and problem solving satisfying, hence, I'm learning  to code and building cool websites. 

My goal is to brush up on HTML and CSS before I move on to JavaScript and other programming languages. Other than Web Development, I am also interested in Data Science and have been enjoying Kaggle short courses. Right now I am working on coding challenges from Frontend Mentor.

- 👩‍💻 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and Python.
- 🤓 I also geek out on geophysics, language learning, and event planning.
- 📖 I'm currently reading **How to Win Friends and Influence People** by Dale Carnegie.
- 📫 You can reach me at <a href="https://twitter.com/aineedtech">aineedtech</a>.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love sushi and [durian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durian) (but maybe not both at the same time).
